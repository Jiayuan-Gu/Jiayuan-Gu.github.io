      <h2>About Joining my Group</h2>
      <p>
        Thank you for your interest in joining my group! I am always looking for motivated students! Unfortunately, due to the large volume of emails I receive, I may not be able to respond to every inquiry. Please read the information below before contacting me!

        <span class="highlight">Prospective Graduate students</span>:
        I am looking for PhD students starting Fall 2026.
        If you have a strong interest or a particular research direction/idea that aligns with my research, please feel free to send me an email with a brief description of your background and research interest.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="highlight">Current ShanghaiTech students</span>: Please send me your CV, transcript, and a brief description of your background and why you are interested in my research. Prior research experience in computer vision, graphics, robotics or machine learning is a plus, but not a prerequisite. However, I do prefer students who've taken some of these classes, or with strong skills in math, physics or coding.
